👋 Hi, I’m @aleduranG.

👀 I’m interested in learning about programming and software development from scratch. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning the basics of programming languages like Python and HTML/CSS. Every day is a new adventure in discovery!

💞️ I’m hoping to find opportunities to contribute to beginner-friendly open-source projects or collaborate with others who are also starting their journey in coding.

📫 You can reach out to me via email at aleeduran@proton.me

😄 Pronouns: She/Her.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently learning English, and programming is helping me practice my language skills in a fun and practical way
